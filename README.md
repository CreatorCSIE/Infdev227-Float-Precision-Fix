# Infdev227-Float-Precision-Fix
**A Mod for Infdev 2010-2-27 which fixes the float precision.**

## What the mod do?
**I used AI to help me fix Infdev (2010-2-27) some distance effects.**

Now the game has no rendering problem unless X/Z>33554432.

## Download
You can download the patch (not recommend) from downloading source code.

Like this: `git clone https://github.com/CreatorCSIE/Infdev227-Float-Precision-Fix.git`

Then copy the files to Infdev (2010-2-27) jar and replace it.

**Don't forget to delete META-INF when you got a SecurityError**

Also, you can download the already [patched version](https://github.com/CreatorCSIE/Infdev227-Float-Precision-Fix/releases), which includes SinglePlayerCommand. (This allows you to use Teleport function without RetroWrapper patching.)

## Single Player Command?

You should install **Single Player Command** first and then use the patch.
